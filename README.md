# Tennis
A tennis game with two players is scored based on a string sequence, with each character of the string
indicating the player who has scored a point at that particular stage in the game.
The scoreboard is displayed after each point has been scored. 
Finally, the winner is declared after the sequence of points has been evaluated.
